# Learn Git

1. Install Git

First, you need to install Git on your computer.

- For Windows: Download and install from
https://git-scm.com/download/win
- For macOS: Install using Homebrew with `brew install git`
- For Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`

2. Configure Git

After installation, configure your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

3. Create a Local Repository

Let's create a new project and initialize a Git repository:

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
```

4. Make Changes and Commit

Create a file and make your first commit:

```bash
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"
```

5. Viewing History

To see your commit history:

```bash
git log
```

6. Create Branches

Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
```

Or use the shorthand:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

7. Merge Branches

After making changes in your feature branch, merge it back to main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```


Fantastic!!!

### NOTE
You maight want to practice this several times, using a differrent project directory name, until you feel comfortable and understand what is happening.
