## Experience Objectives
By the end of this 50-minute experience, students will:
1. Understand the importance of Git and GitHub for tech professionals
2. Learn basic Git commands and concepts
3. Create a GitHub account and practice basic GitHub operations

# Why Tech Students Need Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development. Here's why they're crucial for tech students:

1. **Version Control**: Git allows you to track changes in your code over time. This is invaluable for:
   - Recovering previous versions if something goes wrong
   - Collaborating with others without overwriting each other's work
   - Experimenting with new features without risking the main codebase

2. **Portfolio Building**: GitHub serves as a showcase for your projects, acting as a "code resume" for potential employers.

3. **Collaboration**: GitHub facilitates teamwork, a critical skill in the tech industry. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.

4. **Industry Standard**: Nearly all tech companies use Git and GitHub or similar tools. Familiarity with these tools is often a job requirement.

5. **Open Source Contribution**: GitHub is the hub of open-source development, allowing you to contribute to real-world projects and build your reputation in the tech community.

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Many modern development practices rely on Git for automating testing and deployment processes.

By mastering Git and GitHub, you're not just learning tools; you're adopting professional workflows that will serve you throughout your tech career.

# Let's Get Started!

### Before we can actually begin learning Git and GitHub, I want to make certain everyone knows how to access their terminal, or Command Line, on their Laptop or Desktop.

The **terminal**, or **command line**, is where you will type the code you will see in the Git and GitHub Lessons.

- So, now let's access your **terminal** before we proceed.

## 0. Access the Terminal

Before we begin, you need to access the **terminal** (command line interface) on your computer:

- **For Windows**: 
  1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
  2. Type `cmd` and press Enter to open Command Prompt
  3. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell or Git Bash (installed with Git)

- **For macOS**:
  1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight Search

  2. Type `Terminal` and press Enter

Once you have the **terminal** open, you're ready to start using Git commands.


# Here Are The Hands-On Lessons and Assignment

Ater you have discovered where your **terminal** is, and how to access it whenever you need it, you will start going through the lessons in order below, by clicking on the **Lesson** or **Assignment** Name.

These are designed to be hands-0n, which means follow along with me and do everything I am doing in the instructions.
- That is the only way you can learn **Git** and **GitHub**.
