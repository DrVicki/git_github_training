2. Learn basic Git commands and concepts
3. Create a GitHub account and practice basic GitHub operations

# Why Tech Students Need Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development. Here's why they're crucial for tech students:

1. Version Control: Git allows you to track changes in your code over time. This is invaluable for:
   - Recovering previous versions if something goes wrong
   - Collaborating with others without overwriting each other's work
   - Experimenting with new features without risking the main codebase

2. Portfolio Building: GitHub serves as a showcase for your projects, acting as a "code resume" for potential employers.

3. Collaboration: GitHub facilitates teamwork, a critical skill in the tech industry. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.

4. Industry Standard: Nearly all tech companies use Git and GitHub or similar tools. Familiarity with these tools is often a job requirement.

5. Open Source Contribution: GitHub is the hub of open-source development, allowing you to contribute to real-world projects and build your reputation in the tech community.

6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Many modern development practices rely on Git for automating testing and deployment processes.

By mastering Git and GitHub, you're not just learning tools; you're adopting professional workflows that will serve you throughout your tech career.

# Let's Get Started!

### Before we can actually begin learning Git and GitHub, I want to make certain everyone knows how to access their terminal, or Command Line, on their Laptop or Desktop.

The terminal, or command line, is where you will type the code you will see in the Git and GitHub Lessons. 

- So, now let's access your terminal before we proceed.

## 0. Access the Terminal

Before we begin, you'll need to access the terminal (command line interface) on your computer:

- For Windows: 
  1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
  2. Type `cmd` and press Enter to open Command Prompt
  3. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell or Git Bash (installed with Git)

- For macOS:
  1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight Search
  2. Type `Terminal` and press Enter

- For Linux:
  1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the Terminal
  2. Or search for "Terminal" in your applications menu

Once you have the terminal open, you're ready to start using Git commands.
